Q. What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? If you're stuck, discuss with your cohort in Slack.

A. When the screen is resized to less than 550px as well as the elements rearranging themselves on the grid so that they fit within the screen they also change size i.e. the font size changes. I think it works by using media queries which determine the size of screen the page is being viewed on and then uses the appropriate CSS to adjust the grid and typography. How this exactly works in practice I'm not sure because the index file appears to be linked to 3 CCS files - normalsze.css, skeleton.css and custom.css. I assume it cascades down  working through the code and from the media query answer selects the appropriate part of the CSS to display the content.
