Q. What is you site's primary purpose?
A. At this point the primary purpose of my site is to have a place where I can record my reflections on the  things I learn as I progress through the course. Its main content will be a series of cultural and technical blogs about my thoughts on particular topics we cover in each set of sprint assignments. Having looked at cohorts sites that are ahead of us it will also start to include project work and a bio about me and could eventually evolve into a portfolio for future employers

Q. Who is your target audience?
A. My target audience is myself, fellow students and teachers at EDA and maybe potential employers or clients

Q. How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
A. I want the experience to be informative, entertaining and seamless so that it is obvious what the site's purpose is, it is easy to navigate and is responsive. Hopefully it will be pleasing to the eye for most people as well.

Q. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
A. I will build my site with the audience in mind, using good design practices such as having a site map, using  wireframes and boxifying elements so I can prioritise important features. The site should be responsive, have good performance and be tested so that it works well on a variety of devices and browsers.
